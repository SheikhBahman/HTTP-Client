Note that the newlines are technically supposed to be CRLF - “\r\n”. Only the first line is essential for a server to know what file to give back, so your HTTP GETs can be just that first line. HTTP specifies that the end of a request should be marked by a blank line – so be sure to have two newlines at the end. (This demarcation is necessary because TCP presents you a stream of bytes, rather than packets.) You may use either HTTP 1.0 or 1.1. However, notice that if you are using HTTP/1.0, the Host header is NOT REQUIRED. If you are using HTTP/1.1, the Host header is REQUIRED. But be aware that the Host header may still be necessary for some URLs even in HTTP/1.0.
Is global warming to blame for the Syrian war? Democratic presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke and Bernie Sanders seem to think so. At the CNN climate town hall this month, Buttigieg and O'Rourke referred to climate change as a national security threat that contributed to causing the Syrian civil war. “Wars that were precipitated by climate change, like Syria, will pale in comparison to the wars that we see in the future,” O'Rourke warned. Both candidates follow the lead of Sanders, who has long claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism”. Recently, he told his followers, “Climate change is one of the greatest threats to global security. As we see more drought, as poor people are not able to grow the food they need, there will be migrations of millions of people all over the world.”
